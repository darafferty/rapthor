Operations
==========

Most of the processing performed by Rapthor is done in "operations," which are sets of steps that are grouped together into CWL workflows. The available operations and the primary data products of each are described in detail below.


.. _calibrate:

Calibrate
---------

This operation calibrates the data using the current sky model. The exact steps done during calibration depend on the strategy, but essentially there are two main parts: a phase-only (scalar) solve on short timescales (the "fast-phase" solve, which corrects for ionospheric errors) and a phase and amplitude (diagonal) solve on long time scales (the "slow-gain" solve, which corrects for beam errors). The slow-gain solve is divided into two parts: an optional amplitude-only solve that constrains all stations to have the same solutions and a phase plus amplitude solve (without the station constraint and usually with a longer solution interval). This calibration strategy is based on the LBA strategy of the `LiLF pipeline <https://linc.readthedocs.io/>`_, with the idea that the same strategy can be used for both HBA and LBA (similar to the way the calibrator pipeline works in LINC). Lastly, processing of the resulting solutions is done, including smoothing, renormalization, and the generation of a-term images (if 2-D screens are used).

For calibration, Rapthor searches for bright, compact sources (or groups of sources) throughout the field to use as calibrator sources. A target (apparent) flux density is used to ensure that the calibrators are sufficiently bright (set by :term:`target_flux` in the processing strategy). Rapthor then tessellates the full sky model, using the calibrators as the facet centers. This method ensures that each calibration patch (or facet) has a bright calibrator source in it. Despite this designation of calibrators for the tesselation, all sources are used in the calibration (not just the bright sources).

When multiple nodes are available, this task is distributed.

Primary products:
    * In ``skymodels/calibrate_X``, where ``X`` is the cycle number:
        * ``calibration_skymodel.txt`` - the sky model used for calibration, grouped into calibration patches (one per facet/direction). If a sky model was supplied by the user, this model will be identical (but potentially with a different grouping of the sources). If the sky model results from the previous cycle of self calibration, this model will be the sum of models from the imaging sectors (see :ref:`image` for details).
    * In ``solutions/calibrate_X``, where ``X`` is the cycle number:
        * ``field-solutions.h5`` - the calibration solution table containing both fast-phase and slow-gain solutions.
    * In ``plots/calibrate_X``, where ``X`` is the cycle number:
        * ``*.png`` files - plots of the calibration solutions. Plots are typically made with one file per direction (calibration patch), per solution type (amplitude, phase, or scalar phase). For example, the file ``scalarphase_dir[Patch_127].png`` contains the scalar phase solutions (from the "fast-phase" solve) for patch 127. If the "slow-gain" solve was done, additional files should be present with the names ``phase_dir[Patch_127]_polXX.png`` and ``amplitude_dir[Patch_127]_polXX.png`` (and similarly for the YY polarization). If the optional amplitude-only slow-gain solve was done, the solutions are combined with the phase plus amplitude solve before plotting.

.. _predict:

Predict
-------

This operation predicts visibilities for subtraction. Sources that lie outside of imaged regions are subtracted, as are bright sources inside imaged regions (if desired). This operation will not be run if no prediction or subtraction needs to be done.

When multiple nodes are available, this task is distributed.

Primary products:
    * In ``skymodels/predict_X``, where ``X`` is the cycle number:
        * ``outlier_*_predict_skymodel.txt`` - sky models used for outlier subtraction
        * ``bright_source_*_predict_skymodel.txt`` - sky models used for bright-source subtraction
        * ``sector_*_predict_skymodel.txt`` - sky models used when multiple imaging sectors are used
    * In ``pipelines/predict_X``, where ``X`` is the cycle number:
        * Temporary measurement sets used for subsequent operations.

.. _image:

Image (+ mosaic)
----------------

This operation images the data. If multiple imaging sectors are used, a mosaic operation is also run to mosaic the sector images together into a single image. If bright sources were subtracted in the preceding :ref:`predict` operation, they are restored during this operation once imaging has finished.

Diagnostics for each image are written to the main log (``dir_working/logs/rapthor.log``). The diagnostics can be useful for judging how self calibration is proceeding. They include the following:

    * The minimum and theoretical RMS noise. The minimum noise is derived from 2-D RMS maps generated by PyBDSF using the non-primary beam corrected image. The theoretical noise is calculated following `SKA Memo 113 <http://www.skatelescope.org/uploaded/59513_113_Memo_Nijboer.pdf>`_ and the `LOFAR Image Noise Calculator <https://support.astron.nl/ImageNoiseCalculator/sens.php>`_. The calculation takes into account the amount of flagged data but does not include the effects of elevation.
    * The median RMS noise. The median noise is derived from 2-D RMS maps generated by PyBDSF using the non-primary beam corrected image. This median noise, along with the dynamic range (see below) is used to determine whether selfcal has converged (using the :term:`convergence_ratio` and :term:`divergence_ratio` defined by the processing strategy).
    * The dynamic range, calculated as the maximum value in the image divided by the minimum RMS noise, using the non-primary beam corrected image. This quantity gives an estimate of how well focused the brightest source in the image is and is used, along with the median noise (see above) and the number of sources found in the image (see below) to determine whether selfcal has converged.
    * The number of sources found by PyBDSF. As with the noise and dynamic range estimates, the number of sources is used to determine whether selfcal has converged.
    * The reference (central) frequency of the image.
    * The restoring beam size and position angle.
    * The fraction of unflagged data.
    * An estimate of the LOFAR-to-TGSS flux ratio (calculated as the mean of the measured LOFAR flux densities divided by the TGSS flux densities, after sigma clipping). This ratio gives an indication of the accuracy of the overall flux scale of the image. When the reference frequency of the LOFAR image differs from that of the TGSS catalog, the ratio is corrected assuming a mean source spectral index of -0.7.

        .. note::

            This ratio should be considered as a rough estimate only. A careful analysis of the overall flux calibration of the field should be done outside of Rapthor.

    * Estimates of the LOFAR-to-TGSS RA and Dec offsets (calculated as the mean of the LOFAR values minus the TGSS values, after sigma clipping). These offsets give an indication of the accuracy of the astrometry.

Primary products:
    * In ``images/image_X``, where ``X`` is the cycle number:
        * ``field-MFS-image.fits`` - the Stokes I image, uncorrected for the primary beam attenuation (i.e., the apparent-sky, "flat-noise" image)
        * ``field-MFS-image-pb.fits`` - the Stokes I image, corrected for the primary beam attenuation (i.e., the true-sky image)
        * ``field-MFS-residual.fits`` - the Stokes I residual image
        * ``field-MFS-model.fits`` - the Stokes I model image
    * In ``skymodels/image_X``, where ``X`` is the cycle number:
        * ``bright_source_skymodel.txt`` - sky model used to restore bright sources after imaging (present only if bright sources were subtracted in the preceding predict operation).
        * ``sector_Y.true_sky.txt``, where ``Y`` is the image sector number - the sky model (generated by WSClean) for the sector, with true-sky flux densities.
        * ``sector_Y.apparent_sky.txt``, where ``Y`` is the image sector number - the sky model for the sector, with apparent-sky flux densities, generated from the true-sky one by attenuating it with the LOFAR primary beam.
