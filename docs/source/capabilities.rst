Capabilities of rapthor
=======================

Rapthor corrects for direction-dependent effects in HBA LOFAR data, including ionospheric effects and beam-model errors. These corrections are essential to obtaining instrumental-noise limited (~ 0.1 mJy/beam for an 8-hour observation), high-resolution (~ 5 arcsec FWHM) images.
