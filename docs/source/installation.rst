Installation FAQ
----------------

How can I use containers (Docker or Singularity) with Rapthor?
    Containers can be used with Rapthor in two ways: by running it completely within the container (only for use on a single machine, no installation necessary) or by installing it locally and running only the pipelines within the container (for use on a single machine or on multiple nodes of a compute cluster). A Docker image with the latest release of Rapthor and all its dependencies is available `here <https://todo>`_.
