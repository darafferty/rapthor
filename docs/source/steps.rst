Preparing the data (see :ref:`data_preparation`)
    Rapthor requires that the input data be prepared in a specific way. This step involves running the LOFAR initial calibration (LINC) pipelines.

Making a rapthor parset (see :ref:`rapthor_parset`)
    This step involves making the parset that defines the options of the Rapthor run.

Running rapthor (see :ref:`running`)
    This step involves running Rapthor and checking its progress and output.
