.. _rapthor_parset:

The Rapthor parset
==================

Before Rapthor can be run, a parset describing the reduction must be made. The parset is a
simple text file defining the parameters of a run in a number of sections. For example, a
minimal parset for a basic reduction on a single machine could look like the following
(see :ref:`tips` for tips on setting up an optimal parset):

.. code-block:: none

    [global]
    dir_working = /path/to/rapthor/working/dir
    input_ms = /path/to/input/dir/input.ms


The available options are described below under their respective sections.

.. note::

    An example parset is available `here
    <https://git.astron.nl/RD/rapthor/-/blob/master/examples/rapthor.parset>`_.

.. _parset_global_options:

``[global]``
------------

.. glossary::

    dir_working
        Full path to working dir where rapthor will run (required). All output will be
        placed in this directory. E.g., ``dir_working = /data/rapthor``.

    input_ms
        Full path to directory containing the input MS files (required). Wildcards can be
        used (e.g., ``input_ms = /path/to/data/*.ms``). Note that Rapthor works on a copy
        of these files and does not modify the originals in any way. If multiple
        measurement sets are provided, they should be split in time. This is (currently)
        inconsistent with how `LINC <https://linc.readthedocs.io/>`_ outputs the
        measurement sets, which are split in frequency. Processing LINC outputs requires
        concatenating the measurement sets, see :doc:`preparation`.

    download_initial_skymodel
        Download the initial sky model automatically instead of using a user-provided one
        (default is ``True``). This option is ignored if a file is specified with the
        :term:`input_skymodel` option.

    download_initial_skymodel_radius
        The radius in degrees out to which a sky model should be downloaded (default is
        5.0).

    download_initial_skymodel_server
        Place to download the initial sky model from (default is ``TGSS``). This can
        either be ``TGSS`` to use the TFIR GMRT Sky Survey or ``GSM`` to use the Global
        Sky Model.

    download_overwrite_skymodel
        Overwrite any existing sky model with a downloaded one (default is ``False``).

    input_skymodel
        Full path to the input sky model file, with true-sky fluxes (required if automatic
        download is disabled). If you also have a sky model with apparent flux densities,
        specify it with the :term:`apparent_skymodel` option.

	See :doc:`preparation` for more info on preparing the sky model.

    apparent_skymodel
        Full path to the input sky model file, with apparent-sky fluxes (optional). Note
        that the source names must be identical to those in the :term:`input_skymodel`.

    regroup_input_skymodel
        Regroup input skymodel as needed to meet target flux (default = ``True``). If
        False, the existing patches are used for the calibration.

    strategy
        Name of processing strategy to use (default = ``selfcal``). A custom strategy can
        be used by giving instead the full path to the strategy file. See
        :ref:`rapthor_strategy` for details on making a custom strategy file.

    selfcal_data_fraction
        Fraction of data to use (default = 0.2). If less than one, the input data are
        divided by time into chunks that sum to the requested fraction, spaced out evenly
        over the full time range. Using a low value (0.2 or so) is strongly recommended
        for typical 8-hour, full-bandwidth observations.

    final_data_fraction
        A final data fraction can be specified (default = 1.0) such that a final
        processing pass (i.e., after selfcal finishes) is done with a different fraction.

    flag_abstime
        Range of times to flag (default = no flagging). The syntax is that of the
        preflagger ``abstime`` parameter (see the DP3 `documentation
        <https://dp3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for details of the syntax).
        E.g., ``[12-Mar-2010/11:31:00.0..12-Mar-2010/11:50:00.0]``.

    flag_baseline
        Range of baselines to flag (default = no flagging). The syntax is that of the
        preflagger ``baseline`` parameter (see the DP3 `documentation
        <https://dp3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for details of the syntax).
        E.g., ``flag_baseline = [CS013HBA*]``.

    flag_freqrange
        Range of frequencies to flag (default = no flagging). The syntax is that of the
        preflagger ``freqrange`` parameter (see the DP3 `documentation
        <https://dp3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for details of the syntax).
        E.g., ``flag_freqrange = [125.2..126.4MHz]``.

    flag_expr
        Expression that defines how the above flagging ranges are combined to produce the
        final flags (default = all ranges are ``AND``-ed). The syntax is that of the
        preflagger ``expr`` parameter (see the DP3 `documentation
        <https://dp3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for details of the syntax).
        E.g., ``flag_freqrange or flag_baseline``.

``[calibration]``
-----------------

.. glossary::

    llssolver
        The linear least-squares solver to use (one of ``qr``, ``svd``, or ``lsmr``;
        default = ``qr``).

    maxiter
        Maximum number of iterations to perform during calibration (default = 150).

    propagatesolutions
        Propagate solutions to next time slot as initial guess (default = ``True``)?

    solveralgorithm
        The algorithm used for solving (one of ``directionsolve``, ``directioniterative``,
        ``lbfgs``, or ``hybrid``; default = ``hybrid``). When using ``lbfgs``, the
        :term:`stepsize` should be set to a small value like 0.001.

    onebeamperpatch
        Calculate the beam correction once per calibration patch (default = ``False``)? If
        ``False``, the beam correction is calculated separately for each source in the
        patch. Setting this to ``True`` can speed up calibration and prediction, but can
        also reduce the quality when the patches are large.

    parallelbaselines
        Parallelize model calculation over baselines, instead of parallelizing over
        directions (default = ``False``).

    sagecalpredict
        Use SAGECal for model calculation, both in predict and calibration (default = ``False``).

    stepsize
        Size of steps used during calibration (default = 0.02). When using
        :term:`solveralgorithm` = ``lbfgs``, the stepsize should be set to a small value
        like 0.001.

    tolerance
        Tolerance used to check convergence during calibration (default = 1e-3).

    fast_timestep_sec
        Time step used during fast phase calibration, in seconds (default = 8).

    fast_freqstep_hz
        Frequency step used during fast phase calibration, in Hz (default = 1e6).

    fast_smoothnessconstraint
        Smoothness constraint bandwidth used during fast phase calibration, in
        Hz (default = 3e6).

    fast_smoothnessreffrequency
        Smoothness constraint reference frequency used during fast phase calibration, in
        Hz. If not specified this will automatically be set to 144 MHz for HBA or the
        midpoint of the frequency coverage for LBA.

    fast_smoothnessrefdistance
        Smoothness constraint reference distance used during fast phase calibration, in
        m (default = 0).

    slow_timestep_joint_sec
        Time step used during the first slow gain calibration, where a joint solution is
        found for all stations, in seconds (default = 0). Set to 0 to disable this part of
        the slow-gain calibration.

    slow_timestep_separate_sec
        Time step used during the second slow gain calibration, where separate solutions
        are found for each station, in seconds (default = 600).

    slow_freqstep_hz
        Frequency step used during slow amplitude calibration, in Hz (default = 1e6).

    slow_smoothnessconstraint_joint
        Smoothness constraint bandwidth used during the first slow gain calibration,
        where a joint solution is found for all stations, in Hz (default = 3e6).

    slow_smoothnessconstraint_separate
        Smoothness constraint bandwidth used during the second slow gain calibration,
        where separate solutions are found for each station, in Hz (default = 3e6).

    solverlbfgs_dof
       Degrees of freedom for the LBFGS solver (only used when :term:`solveralgorithm` =
       ``lbfgs``; default 200.0).

    solverlbfgs_minibatches
       Number of minibatches for the LBFGS solver (only used when :term:`solveralgorithm`
       = ``lbfgs``; default 1).

    solverlbfgs_iter
       Number of iterations per minibatch in the LBFGS solver (only used when
       :term:`solveralgorithm` = ``lbfgs``; default 4).

.. _parset_imaging_options:

``[imaging]``
-------------

.. glossary::

    cellsize_arcsec
        Pixel size in arcsec (default = 1.25).

    robust
        Briggs robust parameter (default = -0.5).

    min_uv_lambda
        Minimum uv distance in lambda to use in imaging (default = 0).

    max_uv_lambda
        Maximum uv distance in lambda to use in imaging (default = 0).

    taper_arcsec
        Taper to apply when imaging, in arcsec (default = 0).

    do_multiscale_clean
        Use multiscale cleaning (default = ``True``)?

    dde_method
        Method to use to correct for direction-dependent effects during imaging: ``none``,
        ``facets``, or ``screens`` (default = ``facets``). If ``none``, the solutions
        closest to the image centers will be used. If ``facets``, Voronoi faceting is
        used. If ``screens``, smooth 2-D screens are used.

    screen_type
        Type of screen to use (default = ``tessellated``), if :term:`dde_method` =
        ``screens``: ``tessellated`` (simple, smoothed Voronoi tessellated screens) or
        ``kl`` (Karhunen-Lo`eve screens).

    idg_mode
        IDG (image domain gridder) mode to use in WSClean (default = ``hybrid``). The mode
        can be ``cpu`` or ``hybrid``.

    mem_gb
        Maximum memory in GB (per node) to use for WSClean jobs (default = 0 = all
        available memory).

        .. note::

            If the :term:`mem_per_node_gb` parameter is set, then the maximum memory
            for WSClean jobs will be set to the smaller of ``mem_gb`` and
            ``mem_per_node_gb``.

    apply_diagonal_solutions
        Apply separate XX and YY corrections during facet-based imaging (default =
        ``True``). If ``False``, scalar solutions (the average of the XX and YY
        solutions) are applied instead. (Separate XX and YY corrections are always applied
        when using non-facet-based imaging methods.)

    dd_psf_grid
        The number of direction-dependent PSFs which should be fit horizontally and
        vertically in the image (default = ``[1, 1]`` = direction-independent PSF).

    use_mpi
        Use MPI to distribute WSClean jobs over multiple nodes (default = ``False``)? If
        ``True`` and more than one node can be allocated to each WSClean job (i.e.,
        ``max_nodes`` / ``num_images`` >= 2), then distributed imaging will be used (only
        available if :term:`batch_system` = ``slurm``).

        .. note::

            If MPI is activated, :term:`dir_local` (under the
            :ref:`parset_cluster_options` section below) must not be set unless it is on a
            shared filesystem.

        .. note::

            Currently, Toil does not fully support ``openmpi``. Because of this, imaging
            can only use the worker nodes, and the master node will be idle.

    reweight
        Reweight the visibility data before imaging (default = ``False``). If ``True``,
        data with high residuals (compared to the predicted model visibilities) are
        down-weighted. This feature is experimental and should be used with caution.

    grid_width_ra_deg
        Size of area to image when using a grid (default = 1.7 * mean FWHM of the primary
        beam).

    grid_width_dec_deg
        Size of area to image when using a grid (default = 1.7 * mean FWHM of the primary
        beam).

    grid_center_ra
        Center of area to image when using a grid (default = phase center).

    grid_center_dec
        Center of area to image when using a grid (default = phase center).

    grid_nsectors_ra
        Number of sectors along the RA axis (default = 0). The number of sectors in Dec
        will be determined automatically to ensure the whole area specified with
        :term:`grid_center_ra`, :term:`grid_center_dec`, :term:`grid_width_ra_deg`, and
        :term:`grid_width_dec_deg` is imaged. Set to 0 to force a single sector for the
        full area. A grid of sectors can be useful for computers with limited memory but
        generally will give inferior results compared to an equivalent single sector.

    sector_center_ra_list
        List of image centers (default = ``[]``). Instead of a grid, imaging sectors can
        be defined individually by specifying their centers and widths.

    sector_center_dec_list
        List of image centers (default = ``[]``).

    sector_width_ra_deg_list
        List of image widths, in degrees (default = ``[]``).

    sector_width_dec_deg_list
        List of image  widths, in degrees (default = ``[]``).

    max_peak_smearing
        Max desired peak flux density reduction at center of the image edges due to
        bandwidth smearing (at the mean frequency) and time smearing (default = 0.15 = 15%
        reduction in peak flux). Higher values result in shorter run times but more
        smearing away from the image centers.


.. _parset_cluster_options:

``[cluster]``
-------------

.. glossary::

    batch_system
        Cluster batch system (only used when Toil is the CWL runner; default =
        ``single_machine``). Use ``single_machine`` when running on a single machine and
        ``slurm`` to use multiple nodes of a SLURM-based cluster.

    max_nodes
        When :term:`batch_system` = ``slurm``, the maximum number of nodes of the cluster
        to use at once (default = 12).

    cpus_per_task
        When :term:`batch_system` = ``slurm``, the number of processors per task to
        request (default = 0 = all). By setting this value to the number of processors per
        node, one can ensure that each task gets the entire node to itself, which is the
        recommended way of running Rapthor.

    mem_per_node_gb
        When :term:`batch_system` = ``slurm``, the amount of memory per node in GB to
        request (default = 0 = all).

    max_cores
        Maximum number of cores per task to use on each node (default = 0 = all).

    max_threads
        Maximum number of threads per task to use on each node (default = 0 = all).

    deconvolution_threads
        Number of threads to use by WSClean during deconvolution (default = 0 = 2/5 of
        ``max_threads``).

    parallel_gridding_threads
        Number of threads to use by WSClean during parallel gridding (default = 0 = 2/5 of
        ``max_threads``).

    dir_local
        Full path to a local disk on the nodes for IO-intensive processing (default = not
        used). The path must exist on all nodes (but does not have to be on a shared
        filesystem). This parameter is useful if you have a fast local disk (e.g., an SSD)
        that is not the one used for :term:`dir_working`. If this parameter is not set,
        IO-intensive processing (e.g., WSClean) will use a default path in
        :term:`dir_working` instead.

        .. note::

            This parameter should not be set in the following situations:

            - when :term:`batch_system` = ``single_machine`` and multiple imaging sectors
              are used (as each sector will overwrite files from the other sectors).

            - when :term:`use_mpi` = ``True`` under the :ref:`parset_imaging_options`
              section and ``dir_local`` is not on a shared filesystem.

    use_container
        Run the workflows inside a container (default = ``False``)? If ``True``, the CWL
        workflow for each operation (such as calibrate or image) will be run inside a
        container. The type of container can be specified with the :term:`container_type`
        parameter.

        .. note::

            This option should not be used when Rapthor itself is being run inside a
            container. See :ref:`using_containers` for details.

    container_type
        The type of container to use when :term:`use_container` = ``True``. The supported
        types are: ``docker`` (the default), ``udocker``, or ``singularity``.

    cwl_runner
        CWL runner to use. Currently supported runners are: ``cwltool`` and ``toil``
        (default). Toil is the recommended runner, since it provides much more
        fine-grained control over the execution of a workflow. For example, Toil can use
        Slurm to automatically distribute workflow steps over different compute nodes,
        whereas CWLTool can only execute workflows on a single node. With CWLTool you also
        run the risk of overloading your machine when too many jobs are run in parallel.
        For debugging purposes CWLTool outshines Toil, because its logs are easier to
        understand.

    dir_coordination
        Set Toil's coordination directory (only used when Toil is the CWL runner; default
        = selected automatically by Toil). In most cases, it should not be necessary to
        set this parameter. However, if errors relating to Toil's ``jobStateFile`` are
        encountered, they may be fixed by setting the coordination directory explicitly.

        .. note::

            This directory must be on a 100% POSIX-compatible file system, because Toil
            heavily depends on POSIX file locking to work reliably. For many shared file
            systems, this criterion is not met.

    debug_workflow
        Debug workflow related issues. Enabling this will require significantly more disk
        space. The working directory will never be cleaned up, ``stdout`` and ``stderr``
        will not be redirectied, and log level of the CWL runner will be set to ``DEBUG``.
        Additionally, when using Toil as the CWL runner, some tasks will run using only a
        single thread (to make debugging easier). Use this option with care!

        .. note::

            If Toil is the CWL runner, this option will only work when
            :term:`batch_system` = ``single_machine`` (the default).
