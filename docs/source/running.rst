Running Rapthor
===============

.. _starting_rapthor:

Starting a Rapthor run
----------------------

.. note::
    For runs on a single machine, the recommended method of running Rapthor is
    to run everything within a container (see :ref:`using_containers` for
    details).

.. note::
    For running rapthor in an SKAO context, see :ref:`running_skao`.

Rapthor can be run from the command line as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rapthor rapthor.parset

where ``rapthor.parset`` is the parset described in :ref:`rapthor_parset`. A
number of options are available and are described below:

.. code-block:: console

    Usage: rapthor parset

    Options:
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -q                    enable quiet mode
      -r RESET, --reset=RESET
                            reset one or more operations so that
                            they will be rerun
      -v                    enable verbose mode

Rapthor begins a run by checking the input measurement sets. Next, Rapthor
will determine the DDE calibrators from the input sky model and begin self
calibration and imaging. Rapthor uses Toil+CWL to handle the distribution of
jobs and to keep track of the state of a reduction. Each Rapthor operation is
done in a separate workflow. See :ref:`structure` for an overview of the various
operations that Rapthor performs and their relation to one another, and see
:ref:`operations` for details of each operation and their primary data products.


.. _using_containers:

Using a (u)Docker/Singularity image
-----------------------------------

Rapthor can use containers in two ways: by running Rapthor completely within a
container (for use on a single machine) or by installing Rapthor locally and running
only the operations within the container (for use with multiple nodes of a
compute cluster).


Running everything in a container (single-machine mode)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For runs on a single machine (i.e., when :term:`batch_system` = ``single_machine``),
the recommended method of running Rapthor is to run everything within a container. To
use this method, first obtain the container image as follows:

For Docker:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker pull astronrd/rapthor

For uDocker:

.. code-block:: console

    $ udocker pull astronrd/rapthor

For Singularity:

.. code-block:: console

    $ singularity pull docker://astronrd/rapthor


Then start the run, making sure that all necessary volumes are accessible from
inside the container, e.g.,:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker run --rm <docker_options> -v <mount_points>:<mount_points> -w $PWD astronrd/rapthor rapthor rapthor.parset

.. code-block:: console

    $ udocker run --rm <docker_options> -v <mount_points>:<mount_points> -w $PWD astronrd/rapthor rapthor rapthor.parset

.. code-block:: console

    $ singularity exec --bind <mount_points>:<mount_points> <rapthor.sif> rapthor rapthor.parset

In this mode, since Rapthor is running fully inside a container, the
:term:`use_container` parameter should *not* be set, as activating this option
instructs Rapthor to run the operations inside another, additional container
(resulting in it running a container inside a container).


Running only the operations in a container (multinode mode)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For runs that use multiple nodes of a compute cluster (i.e., when
:term:`batch_system` = ``slurm``), the recommended method of running Rapthor is
to run the operations (CWL workflows) inside containers, with the parent Rapthor process,
which controls the submission of Slurm jobs, running outside of a container.
Therefore, the use of this mode requires a minimal local installation of Rapthor
on the cluster head node (for details, see the installation instructions on the
`Rapthor GitLab page <https://git.astron.nl/RD/rapthor>`_). Other, non-Python
dependencies (such as DP3 and WSClean) do not need to be installed locally. To
use this mode, activate the :term:`use_container` parameter in the parset. No
further configuration should be necessary, as the CWL runner will handle the
pulling and running of the containers.


.. _troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting a run
---------------------
See the :ref:`faq_installation` for tips on troubleshooting Rapthor.


.. _resuming_rapthor:

Resuming an interrupted run
---------------------------

Due to the potentially long run times and the consequent non-negligible chance
of some unforeseen failure occurring, Rapthor has been designed to allow easy
resumption of a reduction from a saved state and will skip over any steps that
were successfully completed previously. In this way, one can quickly resume a
reduction that was halted (either by the user or due to some problem) by simply
re-running Rapthor with the same parset.


.. _resetting_rapthor:

Resetting an operation
----------------------

Rapthor allows for the processing of an operation to be reset:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rapthor -r rapthor.parset

Upon running this command, a prompt will appear prompting the user to select an
operation to reset:

.. code-block:: console

    INFO - rapthor:state - Reading parset and checking state...

    Current strategy: selfcal

    Operations:
        1) calibrate_1
        2) predict_1
        3) image_1
        4) mosaic_1
        5) calibrate_2
        6) image_2
        7) mosaic_2
        8) calibrate_3
        9) image_3
    Enter number of operation to reset or "q" to quit:

All operations after the selected one will also be reset.
