# Quick installation guide:      
```
git clone --recursive -j4 https://gitlab.com/astron-idg/idg.git      
cd idg     
mkdir build; cd build           
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<idg_install_path> ..       
make install
[ source init-environment.sh ]         
```

## Installation options:      
(Best: use `ccmake` or `cmake -i` to configure all options.)       
```
* BUILD_STATIC_LIBS: build static libraries, instead of shared ones       
* BUILD_LIB_CPU: build library 'libidg-cpu' for usage on CPU's      
* BUILD_LIB_CUDA: build library 'libidg-cuda' for usage on Nvidia GPU's      
* BUILD_LIB_OPENCL: build library 'libidg-opencl' for usage of OpenCL     
* BUILD_WITH_PYTHON: build Python module 'idg' to use IDG from Python       
```
All other build options are for development purposes only, and should be
left at the default values by a regular user.      

All libraries are installed in `'<installpath>/lib'`. The header files in
`'<installpath>/include'`. The Python module in
`'<installpath>/lib/python2.7/dist-packages'`. Make sure that your
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` are set as appropiate.      


# Using IDG in your own cmake project:

## Finding IDG    

In your CMakeLists.txt file, use for instance:     

`find_package(IDG NO_MODULE)`

(See more on the find_package command in the cmake documentation.)      

When building your project, use `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or `IDG_DIR`    

`cmake  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<idg_install_path>  <project_src_path>`
     
or       

`cmake -DIDG_DIR=<idg_install_path> <project_src_path>`

## Predefined varibles from find_package

*  `IDG_INCLUDE_DIR`: general include directories       
*  `IDG_LIB`: IDG library to link against      
*  `IDG_PYTHON_MODULE_PATH`: path to 'idg' python module    

## Linking against IDG

For instance, for the CPU library, include the `idg-cpu.` in your source file. In cmake, set the include path and link to the libarary:     
```
*include_directories (${IDG_INCLUDE_DIR})*    
*target_link_libraries (a.out ${IDG_LIB})*      
```
