# MPI test script.
# Prints the hostname, rank and CPU affinity for each MPI process.
# Usage:
# - Plain mpi command:
#   - mpirun <MPI options> mpitest
# - Run in a SLURM environment:
#   - srun <SLURM options> mpitest
#   - srun <SLURM options> mpirun <MPI options> mpitest
#   - Running 'mpitest' in a SLURM sbatch script is also possible.
