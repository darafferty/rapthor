Quick start
===========
To make images with IDG one can use `WSClean <https://wsclean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ in `IDG mode <https://wsclean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/image_domain_gridding.html>`_. To make this mode available :ref:`build the IDG library <build-instructions-label>` before `building WSClean <https://wsclean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ and make sure the IDG library is found.

To learn how to use IDG as a component in your own software the quickest route is to look at the :ref:`python-demo-label`. To run the python demo the IDG library needs to build with python support, (see :ref:`build-instructions-label`).
