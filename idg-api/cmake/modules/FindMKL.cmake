# - Try to find MKL
# This module tries to find an MKL library on your system.
#
# It looks for MKL libraries in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and tries
# to resolve the include directory relative to the libraries.
# As an alternative, specify MKL_LIB and MKL_INCLUDE manually
#
# Once done this will define
#  MKL_FOUND        - system has MKL
#  MKL_INCLUDE_DIRS - the MKL include directory
#  MKL_LIBRARIES    - link these to use MKL
